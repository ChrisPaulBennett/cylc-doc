.. warning::

   In many cases site administrators will create platform settings -
   to see available platforms::

      cylc config -i [platforms]

   If, however, no suitable platforms are available you can
   write your own platform definitions. These can be created in
   your user configuration files at locations listed in
   :cylc:conf:`global.cylc`.

   .. seealso::

      :ref:`AdminGuide.PlatformConfigs` contains a detailed descriptin
      and examples of how to write platforms.
