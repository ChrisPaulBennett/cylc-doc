.. warning::

   It is anticipated that most platform settings should be set by
   site administrators - to see available platforms::

      cylc config -i [platforms]

   If you are absolutely sure that you **need** to add your own platforms
   these can be created in your user configuration files at locations listed
   in :ref:`global-config`.
