    This class extends the Sphinx command class for setuptools. With
    a difference that it tries to mimic the behaviour of the previous
    `cylc-make-docs`.

    So first it will execute `make-commands.sh`, which builds the
    commands help information, in the appendices.

    Then, instead of calling one builder, this class will call the
    builder fot he single HTML, and also the builder for the multiple
    HTML documentation.

    Finally, one more tweak in this class is to move the doctrees
    folder (in the same level as the documentation) to within the
    documentation folder, named `.doctrees`, as before with
    `cylc-make-docs`.
